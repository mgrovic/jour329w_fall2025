    "summary": "The Trump administration cautioned Maryland against using diversity, equity, and inclusion criteria in contracts for Baltimore’s Key Bridge reconstruction, citing legal risks and inefficiencies. Democrats defended the project's approved status and competitive bidding process, emphasizing the need for swift and efficient rebuilding.",
    "content": "WASHINGTON – The Trump administration on Friday warned Maryland officials not to award contracts based on sex and race in the reconstruction of Baltimore’s Francis Scott Key Bridge.\n“Any reliance on race- or sex-conscious factors in contracting decisions could introduce significant legal vulnerabilities and inefficiencies in the management of the project,” Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy said in a letter to Maryland Gov. Wes Moore on Friday.\nThe secretary criticized the project’s work plan, arguing that Moore has “prioritized race and gender-based requirements ahead of project completion.”\nDemocrats in the Maryland congressional delegation responded in a joint statement, noting the bridge project was approved by Congress.\n“As we have with other major infrastructure disasters with nationwide implications, Congress came together on a bipartisan basis to provide the full resources necessary for reconstruction to ensure it can be rebuilt as quickly and efficiently as possible,” the lawmakers said.\n“The federal government’s commitment to fund the rebuild is enacted into law, and the construction contract was awarded through a legal, competitive, transparent process,” they added.\nMoore did not address Duffy’s comments about sex and race.\n“We will continue to work with the Trump Administration to find ways to reduce costs and rebuild faster,” Gov. Moore said in a statement. “The safety of the bridge and the sound stewardship of taxpayer dollars remain our top priority as we work to fully restore economic vitality—not only to the Port of Baltimore and the State of Maryland, but for the people across the country.”\nAlong with concerns over hiring practices, Duffy also questioned the reconstruction project’s budget.\n“DEI contracting practices and ballooning project costs are already threatening to delay this critical project,” Duffy said in a statement. “We will leverage our oversight authorities to ensure this vital bridge is rebuilt the right way.”\nPresident Donald Trump last month said on social media he might have to “rethink” federal support for the Key Bridge. He called Baltimore “crime-ridden” and “out of control” and has threatened to send federal troops into the city, as he has in Los Angeles, Washington and Memphis.\nTrump’s warning about the bridge funds followed Moore’s invitation to Trump to visit Baltimore or “keep our name out of your mouth.”\nThe bridge collapsed in March 2024 after it was struck by a ship. The demolition of the bridge began in July. Following reconstruction, the bridge is slated to open in the fall of 2028.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tBALTIMORE – The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ then-Chief of Engineers Lt. Gen.

    "summary": "Maryland Democratic lawmakers criticized ABC's suspension of Jimmy Kimmel, viewing it as a threat to free speech and freedom of the press. They introduced legislation to protect against government retaliation for critical speech, expressing concern over potential efforts by the administration to silence critics.",
    "content": "WASHINGTON – Democrats in the Maryland congressional delegation on Friday warned that ABC’s suspension of Jimmy Kimmel Live! following controversial comments on the assassination of Charlie Kirk was a threat to free speech.\n“It represents the type of censorship that we see in authoritarian regimes,” Rep. Johnny Olszewski told Capital News Service in an interview.\nABC’s decision sparked controversy among public officials nationwide, with many characterizing the suspension as an attack on freedom of the press.\n“Under the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, you have the right to engage in speech that is distasteful and offensive and disagreeable to other people,” Rep. Jamie Raskin said on CNN Thursday night. “If you don’t, we don’t have a First Amendment.”\n“Because somebody is offended by MSNBC, somebody is offended by Fox News, somebody is offended by CNN. That’s fine. You can turn it off if you don’t like it,” said Raskin, who is a constitutional lawyer. “But you don’t get to go around as the government and police other people’s speech. Understand, if we go down this road – and it seems like this is where we are – we are destroying the freedom of expression in America.”\nMaryland Sen. Chris Van Hollen joined other congressional Democrats Thursday to unveil a bill designed to protect freedom of speech in the wake of Kimmel’s suspension.\nThe No Political Enemies Act, or NOPE, would outline legal protections limiting the ability of the federal government to “silence or retaliate against critics.”\n“We must…call out those who cave in to his illegal threats. Shame on ABC for buckling under and terminating Jimmy Kimmel,” Van Hollen said at a rally near the United States Capitol Friday afternoon.\nDemocratic lawmakers expressed alarm over how President Donald Trump and his allies may seek to squelch dissent. Rep. Glenn Ivey told CNS: “I just think it’s…an effort by the administration to silence any critics out there.”\n“It is deeply troubling that the president is focused on going after late-night TV hosts instead of lowering costs and helping American families,” said Rep. Sarah Elfreth said in a statement.\nThe president said he is considering a further crackdown on television programming deemed overly critical of his administration, suggesting that “maybe their license should be taken away.”\nTrump praised ABC for the suspension in a Truth Social post, stating, “Congratulations to ABC for finally having the courage to do what had to be done.”\nBrendan Carr, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, appeared to second this opinion.\n“In some quarters, there’s a very concerted effort to try to lie to the American people about the nature” of the Kirk assassination, Carr said on a podcast.\nKimmel’s monologue Wednesday had claimed that Kirk’s assassin was part of the “MAGA gang,” a narrative that the administration has repeatedly challenged.\nCarr has emphasized enforcing the FCC’s public interest standard in response to Kimmel’s controversy, stating that some stations’ “pattern of news distortion” places them at risk of losing their broadcasting licenses.\n“We can do this the easy way or the hard way,” Carr stated. “These companies can find ways to change conduct, to take action…or there’s going to be additional work for the FCC ahead.”\nCarr’s comments prompted responses from a number of Democratic lawmakers, who worry that the FCC head may selectively enforce policy for political purposes.\n“I think he is clearly violating his oath and abusing the role of the FCC,” Ivey said. “It’s not supposed to be a censor to protect any presidential administration, and that’s what he’s turning it into.”\nOlszewski said, “In America, we should be standing firm in defense of free speech. It is one of the defining characteristics of our democracy.”\n\n \nWASHINGTON – Maryland Sen. Chris Van Hollen speaks at the We Are America march on the National Mall on Sept. 19, 2025.

The project, largely funded by the team with an investment of at least $2.7 billion, aims to revitalize the Anacostia Waterfront with a mixed-use development including community and public spaces.",
    "content": "WASHINGTON – The DC Council voted 11-2 Wednesday evening in favor of constructing a new stadium complex in the nation’s capital to once again house the Washington Commanders.\n“Fans of the team can rightly celebrate the return of the Commanders to the district as a major moment in our city’s proud history,” said Ward 6 Councilmember Charles Allen.\nThe resolution authorizes the city to proceed with development plans for a replacement for the Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium, which currently is being demolished.\nWASHINGTON – Crews demolish a portion of the Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium on Sept. 10, 2025. (Sam Cohen/Capital News Service)\n“The District now has a once-in-a-generation opportunity to continue to revitalize the Anacostia Waterfront…and develop a vibrant, mixed-use development featuring community sports, professional sports, public recreation, public park space, and cultural amenities,” the bill stated.\nThe Robert F. Kennedy Campus Redevelopment Act of 2025 authorizes the “redevelopment and management” of the property, including the construction of a new stadium.\nThis arena would relocate the Washington Commanders, the region’s professional football team, from their current stadium in Landover, Maryland, where the franchise has played since 1997.\nThe stadium aspect of the project is scheduled to be completed in December of 2030 while development of the surrounding area is set to be finished in 2040.\nThe new stadium will have a transparent roof and hold crowds of up to 65,000, just slightly smaller than the Northwest Stadium (formerly FedEx Field) in Landover, which holds 67,617.\nThe Washington Commanders are contributing at least $2.7 billion to the property’s development, as well as the full cost of the stadium’s construction, which is estimated to cost below $500 million.\nJurisdiction over the 180-acre property was transferred to the DC Council in January following a decade-long effort to absorb the land from the federal government.\nThe council also has outlined other plans to develop the property, including building restaurants, retail, and around 5,000 housing units. \nThis decision marks the first time in nearly three decades in which the Washington Commanders, previously known as the Washington Redskins, will play a home game in the District of Columbia. \nThe final NFL game played in RFK Stadium took place Dec. 22, 1996. The stadium was used in the following years for other sports events and entertainment. It has been fully closed to the public since 2019."
