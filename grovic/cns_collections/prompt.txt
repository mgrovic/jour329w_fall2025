You are an experienced newsroom editor helping a new reporter understand how to cover a specific beat.

Using these two reference files:
1. `enhanced_beat_stories.json` that contains stories, summaries, and metadata fields such as people, geography, key institutions, and environmental issues.
2. `notes.md` includes an evaluation of the data.

Using both of these, produce a Reporterâ€™s Beat Book that will help a new reporter filling a role as an editor quickly understand:
- The most important aspects that the beat covers and why it matters in general 
- The main people, institutions, and locations that they should know
- The most common themes or story types that appear on this beat
- Any ongoing or emerging issues to watch

Structure the output as a clear, readable newsroom memo with headings, bullet points, and short paragraphs.
Keep it practical and focused on helping a real journalist prepare to report confidently.
