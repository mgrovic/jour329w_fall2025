Thoughts: 
Overall I was impressed with the LLM, and the way it added MetaData.
There were defiently places where it could have improved. For example, there was a whole story that had to MetaData pulled, and just said "LLM Failed" which was a bummer. There was a few stories that had a bunch of key people named, but the LLM only pulled one person out. I need to give the LLM an option for when a MetaData category isn't mentioned, so it can say N/A or not mentioned instead of a weird box. 

I was pretty happy with the environmental_issue metadata. I think the LLM did a better job than I expected pulling out which time of enviormental ascept that the story hit on. 

Next time I will defeintly be more clear in my instruction.
