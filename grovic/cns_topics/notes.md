CNS Topic Analysis Miles Grovic Oct 3rd 2025

- Current topics that seem too broad or too narrow
- Topics that seem to overlap significantly
- Any Maryland-specific topics that seem important

  Just in recent days there are a bunch of Enviormental Stories, obviously government shut down information. In a broader time peirod, it seems like CNS is super focused on location stories, so there are Maryland and DC specifc stories, and Annapolis. I see a lot of local governemnt and policy get picked up, specifcially Maryland related politics and annapolis related politics. 

Cheasepake Bay, Baltimore, Annapolis are locations that are in Maryland and super focused on. A lot about Wes Moore and Maryland State Politcs as well. Hyper focus on Annapolis, I assume because of CNS's bearu in Annapolis. The bay is pretty vital, so I want to keep that as it's own category, although could be grouped in a number of other ones. 

  Government and Politics in general seems over represended. We have the two topic lists encompassing Federal G&P and Maryland G&P, respectivly, as well as many different categories that revolve around some sort of Government, Politics, or Policy: Social Welfare, Taxes, Labor and Employment, Budget, Congress, etc. I do think that some (if not all) of these topics are important and should remian, but as I am typing this, I am trying to figure out how to make it easier to understand or combine/rename 

I feel as though Arts and Culture maybe be a bit under represented. I think that there is a lot that could fall under the category and think that perhaps there are different groups of people who deserve their own arts and culture section? Maybe I am over thinking it. Just seems broad. I might add entertainment to it though.

What I removed
26. Native Americans 
Why 
Overall I saw very very few stories that touched on Native Americans at all, ( I don't think I saw any while doing my scanning), and I do think that stories covering Native Americans are super important, but if it happens rarely, it doesn't need it's own category. (Last story written about Native Americans was 2022) and it talked about Washington DC and Veterans ()




13. Energy
27. Natural Resources
New Category: Energy & Natural Resources
Why I combine them: 
These two topics are are closely connected, so combining them into one category should capture both the production and environmental aspects.



16. Economy
17. Trade
6. Commerce

New Category: Economy
Why I combine them: 
Trade is one of the main drivers and indicators of economic activity. Combining them will help group stories about markets, business, international relations, and policy under a single umbrella categoy. The definition of commerce is the activity of buying and selling, especially on a large scale. doesn't seem like it needs its own category when commerce exists. 


Government, Politics & Public Policy

This might be too simplified, but I am going to do it anyways. All of these are good sub categorys, but I think that this will clean up the topic list quite well. Breaking them up into local and federal categories and combining them all. 
18. Maryland Government and Politics
19. Federal Government and Politics
30. Social Welfare
32. Taxes
24. Labor and Employment
9. Budget
7. Congress

Add 
Baltimore and Washington DC
Locations that CNS will be reporting on that are not named. Important. 

Justice and Law 
Why I combined them: both seem to encompass legality and would work well together. Justice is goverened by law (or should be). I feel as if these fit together quite nicley.
