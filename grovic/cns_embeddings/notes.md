CNS Metadata Miles Grovic 09/24/2025

Embeddings (as far as I know) is when text is broken down into a string over number, and a model is able to group numerous texts together, based on the similarity of their number strings. In practice, this went pretty well. There are clusters of stories that are sorted quite well, by location and topic, however there are defiently things in the "wrong" place, there are janky and misreprenting titles, and there is a large cluster of articles without a label. I think this would be more usefuel if we grouped them on something other than the full text. For example, if we used our CNS tags project, and generated tags for every article, then embedded based on those AI generated tags, I think we get clearer groupings and the clusters are more solidified.
